# Create Toolpad App

The simplest method to start with Toolpad is by using `create-toolpad-app`.
This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Toolpad Core application, with everything already set up. You can use the `--studio` flag if you want to bootstrap a Toolpad Studio project.

## Interactive

You can create a new project interactively by running:

```bash
npx create-toolpad-app@latest
# or
yarn create toolpad-app
# or
pnpm create toolpad-app
```

You then need to provide the name of your project:

```bash
âœ” Enter the name of your project:
```

Enter the name to install the necessary types/dependencies and create a new Toolpad Core project.
